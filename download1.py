#Task Creation â‰  Execution:

#asyncio.create_task() schedules tasks to run in the event loop but doesn't execute them immediately.

#The event loop starts processing tasks when it encounters the first await.

#Execution Flow:

#When await task1 is called:

#The event loop starts executing task1, task2, and task3 concurrently.

#The code pauses at await task1 until task1 completes.

#However, task2 and task3 are already running in the background while waiting for task1
#Maintains Concurrency: Despite appearing sequential, all three tasks run concurrently because they were created before any await is called.
