Assignment: Asynchronous Programming in Python
1. Synchronous vs Asynchronous
Write two Python programs:

a) A synchronous program that simulates downloading three files sequentially. Use time.
   sleep to simulate each file download taking 2 seconds.
b)An asynchronous version of the program using asyncio
  sleep to download the files concurrently.
  
Hint: Measure the execution time of both versions using the time module to observe the difference.
