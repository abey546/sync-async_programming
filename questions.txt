Assignment: Asynchronous Programming in Python
1. Synchronous vs Asynchronous
Write two Python programs:

a) A synchronous program that simulates downloading three files sequentially. Use time.
   sleep to simulate each file download taking 2 seconds.
b)An asynchronous version of the program using asyncio
  sleep to download the files concurrently.
  
Hint: Measure the execution time of both versions using the time module to observe the difference.


2. Creating Coroutines
Write a coroutine called process_data that:

Accepts a data_id and a delay (in seconds).
Prints when it starts processing the data.
Uses await asyncio.sleep to simulate the delay.
Prints when the data processing is complete.
Test this coroutine by calling it with three different data_id values (e.g., 1, 2, 3) and
delays (e.g., 2, 3, 1) using asyncio.run.
